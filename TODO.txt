* In C++ make easy to create several stage frame
* In GUI: Disable the first node input, make it look special
* Create a frame looking like naughting: 2 stages, synchronized,
* Display kick as bar

# New frame Editor
- stage based in row
- click on a link to add a stage in the middle
- render input button, create frame button, release frame button
- choose number of split
- use weight instead of duration
- choose global frame duration
- choose if weight change critical path time, or global frame duration


# Visualizer
* Node have different color
* Display the min frame time and max frame time
* Node Editor use weight instead of duration so frame remain the same time

# Simulation
* Generate in several ticks to keep the application interactive, i.e changing one parameter directly change the result

# Scheduler
* Force synchronization on external event (like input or vsync), and make sure you can dynamically resize
* Pre-designed simulation
