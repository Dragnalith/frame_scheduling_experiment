# New Simulator
* Display framerate
* Display stable frame
* Display average and summary of information
* Look for pattern if frame is not stable
* Enable/Disable Vsync
    * Split GPU in two: Rendering, Wait Presentation
* Lock scrolling on stable frame
=======================================================
# ARCHIVE
* Create a frame looking like naughting: 2 stages, synchronized,

# Visualizer
* Node have different color
* Display the min frame time and max frame time
* Node Editor use weight instead of duration so frame remain the same time

# Simulation
* Generate in several ticks to keep the application interactive, i.e changing one parameter directly change the result

# Scheduler
* Force synchronization on external event (like input or vsync), and make sure you can dynamically resize
* Pre-designed simulation
