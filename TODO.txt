# Visualizer
* All frame of a frame pool as different color but between a loop change the darkness
* Display frame full time below the core timeline (use the same color)
* Improve UI with maybe a correct layout (node editor on top, timeline in the bottom, option on the left)

# Simulation
* Generate in several ticks to keep the application interactive, i.e changing one parameter directly change the result
* Re-generate set the scroll bar to 0 
* Can change the size of the frame pool

# Scheduler
* Force synchronization on external event (like input or vsync), and make sure you can dynamically resize
* Timebox can depends on the same time of a preceding frame
* Generate frame pattern from node editor
