# Visualizer
* Node have different color
* Display the min frame time and max frame time

# Simulation
* A job can depends on several one
* Generate in several ticks to keep the application interactive, i.e changing one parameter directly change the result

# Scheduler
* Force synchronization on external event (like input or vsync), and make sure you can dynamically resize
* Timebox can depends on the same time of a preceding frame
* Pre-designed simulation
