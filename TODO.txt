!!! Changing frame pattern does not disturbe the current simulation

# Visualizer
* Node have different color
* Display frame_pool
* Display Core number and line to easily see core line
* All frame of a frame pool as different color but between a loop change the darkness
* Display the min frame time and max frame time

# Simulation
* Make impossible to change the frame pattern of the current simulation
* A job can depends on several one
* Generate in several ticks to keep the application interactive, i.e changing one parameter directly change the result

# Scheduler
* Force synchronization on external event (like input or vsync), and make sure you can dynamically resize
* Timebox can depends on the same time of a preceding frame
* Pre-designed simulation
